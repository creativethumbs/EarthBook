Comedians rarely make me laugh.  It's not that I don't get the jokes; maybe humor just loses its charm when used in succession.  A witty one-liner in a serious movie can make you laugh twice as hard as the tenth joke in a stand-up show.  Sometimes it helps to be serious all the time because the second you say something remotely funny it feels like a breath of fresh air.  That's why the most serious people are often the most humorous; they understand how good it feels to breathe.
