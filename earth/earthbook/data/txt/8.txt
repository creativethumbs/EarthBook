When I was eight I watched my bird, Spicy, die; crushed like ground pepper by the wheels of a tractor trailer.  I had opened her carrying case after mom told me multiple times not to and she was gone.  The memory would replay itself again and again in my mind; I step out of the car, holding the beige pet container against my chest.  I ask my mom if I can pet Spicy and she tells me no.  It's a nice afternoon, about as nice as it can get in Florida.  Spicy should get some fresh air.  Secretly, I open the container, just a little.  She escapes.  She lands on the road.  A large truck approaches.  It must have been at least three times as tall as me.  My mom is screaming as I run towards Spicy.  I am frantically waving my arms, and Spicy looks at me nonchalantly.  The truck doesn't slow down.  Why isn't it slowing down?  Why wouldn't Spicy move?
