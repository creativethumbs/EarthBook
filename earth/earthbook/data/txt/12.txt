The cat seemed to be having a seizure in front of our car.  Every few seconds its body would spring up into view before falling out of sight.  Up and down, up and down, like a ballet dancer.  My dad was getting anxious because it was almost class time. 

After a while one of the street vendors decided to drag its jumping body out of the way.  It reminded me of those moments in cartoons where a hook would appear from the side of the stage to pull out a bad performer.  The red splotches on the pavement could have been tomatoes.

I canâ€™t remember if I was late for class that day.
