This is a book about death. But you knew that already.

Whenever I think about death I can't help but also think about life--about how it passes you by as quickly as rabbits yet is fragile like bird bones.  

Philosophers say that even induction can't give us confidence about the future because knowing that the sun rose yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, doesn't mean that the sun will rise tomorrow.  This makes us not much more self-assured than chickens crossing the road.  But if fate tries to catch up to us, we might as well run as fast as we can.
