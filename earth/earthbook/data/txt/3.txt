Countless nights are spent with the familiar feeling of panic: What if I run out of ideas?  What if I can't make art?  What if everything I've done was for nothing?  What if I don't sleep tonight (again)?

Dad tells me it's okay and that everyone goes through this sort of phase; like getting hit by a second puberty and you're discovering all these awkward new parts of yourself and your brain is swelling with weird thoughts and you feel exhausted because your legs don't carry you like they used to.
