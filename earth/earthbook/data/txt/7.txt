Gravy was a gray rabbit.  We would take baths together in a red tub on our porch and watch clouds on tree branches.  For a couple of years, we shared a simple and happy existence.

As we were preparing to move to Florida we decided to leave Gravy with a family friend.  But the moment we were going to hand her to him, she escaped.  All of us searched high and low for her.  Nothing.  I anxiously eyed the street her gray fur blended perfectly into.
