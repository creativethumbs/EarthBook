Jumbo didn't do much more than sleep and eat lettuce all day, but he tolerated me so he was a good friend.  Our interactions usually involved me carrying him around the house and him making funny noises because I'd squeeze him a little too hard.  I didn't realize my actions caused him pain and thought his squeaking was normal and kinda cute--like those rubber dog toys you'd find at PetSmart.
